# DAMG6210-Elevator-Management

Repository for implementation of an Elevator Management System on SQL server. 

This repository contains the above implementation through the use of SQL DDL statements, SQL insert procedures, SQL trigger statements, column computation & encryption using Asymmetric Keys, defined Views through Common Table Expression & PIVOT and Horizontal Formatting through XML parsing & String aggregation. 

In addition to that data was also imported by virtue of Data Import Wizard - a utility of MS Visual Studio - by implementing data flow between a Flat File Source and OLE DB Destination using SQL server data tools. 

The repository also contains database design implementation through the initial Entity-Relationship diagram (ERD), Design Document and Third Normal Form normalization.

Specific aspects of the ERD:
1) Eliminated multi-valued and/or composite attribute
2) Removed repeating group
3) Avoided many-to-many relationship
4) Ensured cardinality and partition
5) Ensured Identifying and Non-Identifying relationships
